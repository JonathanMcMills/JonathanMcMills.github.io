I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Economics at the [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu/program/economics-phd/).


Before beginning my Ph.D. program in Economics at Georgia State University, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and Statistics from the University of Ghana, followed by a Master’s degree in Economics with a concentration in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics from Miami University. My academic journey has been shaped by a strong interest in understanding how economic theory and empirical analysis can inform effective public policy, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. I am passionate about using advanced econometric methods and quantitative tools to explore issues in macroeconomics, labor markets, and development, aiming to generate evidence-based insights that contribute to solving real-world problems.
