I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Economics at the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu/program/economics-phd/).


Before beginning my Ph.D. program in Economics at Georgia State University, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and Statistics from the University of Ghana, followed by a Master’s degree in Economics with a concentration in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics from Miami University. My academic journey has been shaped by a strong interest in understanding how economic theory and empirical analysis can inform effective public policy, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. I am passionate about using advanced econometric methods and quantitative tools to explore issues in macroeconomics, public finance and development, aiming to generate evidence-based insights that contribute to solving real-world problems.

In addition to my academic work, I am the Founder and Team Lead of Best Grade Services, an educational and consulting initiative that provides a broad range of services, including private tutoring across various fields of study, GRE preparation, data analytics training, software development, and study abroad consulting. Through Best Grade Services, I strive to empower students and professionals with the skills and resources they need to succeed in academic and global career pursuits.
