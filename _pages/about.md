======

I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. Economics student at [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://econ.unc.edu/graduate). My research interests lie in Applied Micro Economics, specifically Labor, Health and Development Economics.

I am also short term consultant at the World Bank Enterprise Survey ([WBES](https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/en/enterprisesurveys)).
