I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. Economics student at [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://econ.unc.edu/graduate). My research interests lie in Applied Microeconomics, specifically Labor, Health and Development Economics. My current research is in parent-child dynamics and early childhood development.

Prior to the Ph.D. program at UNC Chapel Hill, I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Ghana and my master’s studies at the UNC Greensboro.

I am also a short-term consultant at the World Bank’s Enterprise Analysis Unit, which conducts the World Bank Enterprise Survey. ([WBES](https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/en/enterprisesurveys)). The WBES are nationally representative firm-level surveys with top managers and owners of businesses in over 150 economies, reaching 180 in upcoming years, that provide insight into many business environment topics such as access to finance, corruption, infrastructure, and performance, among others.
