excerpt: 'Government revenue serves as a financial foundation of economic growth. However, governments are unable to mobilize adequate tax revenue because of tax non-compliance. Previous research indicates that both economic and non-economic factors influence the tax payment propensity. Our study focuses on non-economic factors because it offers a better explanation of tax non-compliance than the pure economic factors.'
