### Abstract
The issue of debt sustainability is so important because it has led to the crumbling of so many economies especially when it is not managed well. Ghana has had to resort to the IMF 16 times since independence for a bailout due to debt distress, but this has not yielded significant results to propel the country to development. Debt has crushed so many economies like Greece, Puerto Rico, Argentina, etc. It has become a weapon in the hands of government critics and oppositions throughout the world, and in fact, it equally but ignorantly serves as a marking scheme based on which the performance of a country or a certain government is assessed. This has made governments alert on the issues of debt. It is no wonder the government of Ghana in 2019 accented to a bill that sought to cap government yearly deficit at 5%.
